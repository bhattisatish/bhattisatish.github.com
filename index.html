          <h3>Welcome to Satish Bhat's blog.</h3>

<p>This is my latest attempt to resurrect my blog. After couple of failed attempts at running a blog I gave up on the idea of me writing stuff online. For past few years I have been actively writing stuff meant for internal consumption but nothing that was ever made public. Now with no one to spout my 'gyan' to I decided I needed my own soapbox at the Hydes park :)</p>

<p>As this is my soapbox, I intend to have an one sided debate on things that interest me, like online education, online marketing, machine learning and what not.</p>

<p>What about my older content? I have decided to retire those stuff completely as they are either no more interesting, nor meaningful to anyone nor something I believe represents me anymore.</p>

<p>So here it goes.</p>
